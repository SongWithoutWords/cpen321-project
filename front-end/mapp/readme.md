## TODO list
#### UI  
For patients:
- prescription list screen (like a list of cards)
    - each card could be a component
- prescription detail screen (tap on a card => expanding to this screen)
    - buttons to edit the prescription
- doctor list screen 
- doctor detail screen
    - buttons to send a request

For doctors:
- patient list screen
- patient detail screen

For both:
- message and notification screen (similar to youtube probably)
- Login/Signup screens
- Search bar component
- profile/settings screen

#### Core Functinalities 
- scheduling timers/notifications for prescriptions
- creating patient-doctor relationship
- communication/sync with server (how? when? how often?)
- on-device persistent storage of user data
- retrieving medication data (using APIs or building our own DB?)


#### Stretch goals
- How do we integrate fuzzy find algorithm (on-device? server-side?)
- Google sign-in integration
- Integrate chat feature + sharing medical document?


#### Libraries 
- UI components:
    - React Native Elements 
    - Native Base
    - react-native-material-ui
- Navigation:
    - react navigation
