* Proposed Coding Guidelines
- Avoid singletons, global variables, and shared mutable state
- Prefer composition over inheritance and avoid deep inheritance hierarchies
- Prefer ~Option~ over ~null~ (though use of ~null~ may be necessary when interfacing with Java)
- Prefer immutable data structures and collections (Scala's default collections)
- Prefer immutable case-classes over mutable classes
- Use automatic code formatting for consistent project style (likely ScalaFmt)
